=======

Optimize Stencil is a python utility, consisting of one python package `extended_stencil` and two command line utilities.
It is used to calculate optimal coefficients for an extended stencil used in a Maxwell Solver.
More information can be found in the full documentation and our published research article.


Authors
-------

The original version of this program was written by David Schikel <schinkel.d@posteo.de>.
The current version is maintained by Alexander Blinne <a.blinne@gsi.de>.


Requirements
------------

This utility/package requires Python 3 and SciPy/NumPy.


Recommended modules
-------------------

The module :mod:`psutil` can be optionally used to find the number of physical cores.


Installation
------------

The current version is available via https://git.tpi.uni-jena.de/albn/optimize_stencil.
The package and command line utilites are installed via the usual setup.py invocation.

    git clone git@git.tpi.uni-jena.de:albn/optimize_stencil.git
    ./setup.py install --user


Documentation & API Reference
-----------------------------

The full documentation is maintained using Sphinx and can be built from the `doc` subdirectory of the project sources.


Usage Example
-------------

The command line utilities are easy to use::

    optimize_stencil.py

    optimize_stencil.py --div-free --dtrange 0.6718 1.0

    calculate_omega.py --lehe --params 0.96


Code Example
------------

::

    from extended_stencil import Optimize

    opt = Optimize(args)
    x, fmin = opt.optimize()
    coefficients = opt.stencil.coefficients(x)


Tests
-----

Some unit tests are implemented and can be run using::

    nosetests
